## **Highlighted Projects**

### **1. Historical Construction Estimate Comparison**
- **Overview**: Developed a Power BI dashboard to leverage historical preconstruction estimates in the Multi-Family market sector. The dashboard normalizes costs by time and location using BLS data and city cost indices, making estimates easily comparable.
- **Key Deliverables**: Power BI Dashboard, Python post-processor, Power Automate workflows, Azure Functions for cloud processing.
- **Innovations**:
  - Implemented Haversine formula in Power BI to find the closest city for cost index normalization.
  - Used Z-scores to identify components of estimates that were most similar to a given project.

### **2. Construction Scheduling Executive Dashboard**
- **Overview**: Revamped an outdated dashboard into a powerful tool for scheduling directors, C-suite, and division managers. Tracks project performance, identifies at-risk projects, and ensures schedules align with owner requirements.
- **Key Deliverables**: New `.pbix` file, ERD, SQL scripts, Databricks table structure, and data lineage documentation.

### **3. Construction Schedule Subcontractor Trade ML Classification System**
- **Overview**: Built a Random Forest Classifier with 98% accuracy to automate the manual task of labeling scheduling activities by trade contractor. Developed a Vue.js front-end for users to upload files and receive classified outputs.
- **Key Deliverables**: Model files (`.pkl`), front-end website, and human-in-the-loop reinforcement for ongoing model improvement.
- **Innovations**:
  - Developed industry-specific NLP techniques to recognize trade contractors.
  - Used elbow method to optimize feature set without sacrificing computation efficiency.

### **4. Construction Schedule One Page Visualizer**
- **Overview**: Created a Python script to transform large schedules into a one-page Excel visualization for weekly high-rise progress updates.
- **Key Deliverables**: `.exe` file for end-user deployment.
