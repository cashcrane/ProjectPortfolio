# Construction Schedule Subcontractor Trade ML Classification System

## Project Background
Schedulers at Brasfield & Gorrie, a **$7B+** General Contractor in the Southeast US, faced a significant challenge in assigning trade contractors to schedule activitiesâ€”a task that required analyzing thousands of activities weekly and manually assigning trade labels. This process was time-intensive, prone to human error, diverted attention from higher-value scheduling tasks, and many times did not get done.

To address this, I developed a machine learning solution that automates the classification of scheduling activities by trade contractor. The final proposed solution leverages supervised learning through a Random Forest Classifier. The model was trained on **514+** records and achieves **98%** accuracy, ensuring reliable trade assignments with minimal effort.

Key client needs addressed:

Efficiency: Eliminated the **1.5-hour** weekly manual process per project scheduler.
Accuracy: Reduced errors by leveraging a robust machine learning model that meets a minimum of 80% model accuracy in order to match the current accuracy by Schedulers.
Scalability: Enabled the processing of thousands of schedule activities in seconds, making it suitable for large-scale projects.
The solution integrates seamlessly into existing workflows via a Vue.js-powered web app, allowing schedulers to upload Excel schedules exported from Primavera P6 scheduling software and receive trade-labeled outputs instantly. This innovation not only saves over **3,000** man-hours annually but also enables the data to be used for other purposes such as: Monte-Carlo Risk Simulations, ability to analyze Sub-Contractor's performance, create historical durations, and lay the foundations for automating professional construction schedule generation with AI.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**: Pandas, numpy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, re
- **ML File Handling**: pickle, h5
- **DataBricks SQL**: Cloud Data Storage
- **FastAPI**: Back-end deployment
- **Vue.js**: Front-end
- **Docker**: Containerization

## Data
The dataset includes 514K records of construction scheduling activities in every market vertical (Hospitals, Infrastructure, Apartments, Multi-Family, Data Centers, Office Buildings, etc.). Data was sourced from the clients proprietary data set of commercial construction projects all over the US.
- **Activity Name**: Text describing the work being done.
- **WBS Name**: Text describing the Work Breakdown Structure.
- **Trade Label**: The assigned sub-contractor scope of work (Electrical, Mechanical, etc.) (target variable). There were 56 classes of trade responsibilities.

## Sample Dataset

```python
# Top 5 rows of the dataset
data = [
    {"Activity Name": "Install Electrical Conduit", "WBS Name": "Electrical Systems", "Trade Label": "Electrical"},
    {"Activity Name": "Pour Concrete Foundation", "WBS Name": "Foundation & Substructure", "Trade Label": "Concrete"},
    {"Activity Name": "Install HVAC Ductwork", "WBS Name": "Mechanical Systems", "Trade Label": "Mechanical"},
    {"Activity Name": "Apply Paint to Interior Walls", "WBS Name": "Interior Finishes", "Trade Label": "Painting"},
    {"Activity Name": "Erect Structural Steel Beams", "WBS Name": "Structural Frame", "Trade Label": "Structural Steel"}
]
