        "This code retrieves and preprocesses construction schedule data from Databricks to create a dataset for machine learning. The final dataset includes trade classifications for activities, sampled to ensure balance across categories.\n",

        "* Merges activity data with trade classifications\n",
        "* Assigns custom trade labels based on activity names and codes.\n",
        "* Filters out irrelevant or invalid entries.\n",
        "* Samples up to 9,500 rows per trade category for balanced training data and to achieve minimum of half a million samples.\n",
        "3. Data Storage:\n",
        "* Saves the processed data as an HDF5 file for use in the modeling pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Notes**\n",
        "* Credentials should be securely managed using environment variables or a secrets file.\n",
        "* The query can be customized to include additional filters or classifications.\n"
